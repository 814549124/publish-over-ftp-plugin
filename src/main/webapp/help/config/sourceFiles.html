<div>
    <p>Files to upload to a FTP server.</p>
    <p>The string is an Ant fileset eg. '**/*.jar' and can also use the Hudson environment variables eg. $JOB_NAME or $BUILD_NUMBER.<br />
    The base directory for this fileset is the workspace, unless this publisher is an action within a promotion
        - in that case the base directory is the artifacts directory of the build that is being promoted.
